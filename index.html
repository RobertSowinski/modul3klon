                    <h6 class="fst-italic mt-50">by Joji</h6>
                    <p class="verse">She'd take the world off my shoulders<br>
                    if it was ever hard to move <br>
                    She'd turn the rain to a rainbow<br>
                    when I was living in the blue<br>
                     Why then, if she's so perfect,<br>
                    do I still wish that it was you?<br>
                    Perfect don't mean that it's working,<br>
                    so what can I do? (Ooh)</p>
                    <p class="bridge">When you're out of sight in my mind</p>
                    <p class="chorus">'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes,<br>
                    and that's where I find a glimpse of us<br>
                    And I try to fall for her touch,<br>
                    but I'm thinking of the way it was<br>
                    Said, "I'm fine" and said, "I moved on"<br>
                    I'm only here passing time in her arms<br>
                    Hoping I'll find a glimpse of us</p>
                    <p class="verse">Tell me he savors your glory,<br>
                    does he laugh the way I did?<br>
                    Is this a part of your story?<br>
                    One that I had never lived<br>
                    Maybe one day, you'll feel lonely<br>
                    And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse<br>
                    Maybe you'll start slipping slowly and find me again</p>
